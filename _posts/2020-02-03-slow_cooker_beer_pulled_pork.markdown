Pulled pork is one of those things that's nearly impossible to mess up. 
The great thing about pulled pork also is you can do so many things with it, so when I tend to make it, I make a big batch and end up eating it for days in various ways - pulled pork burgers, in burritos, on top of a baked potato, over nachos, on top of a pizza... there really is alot of different ways to use it up.
This recipe has beer in it also because, to be honest... I really like cooking with beer (as well as drinking it).

# Ingredients

Pork shoulder is probably best for this but loin or ham fillet will work too or any large cut of pork with some fat running through it.
There's no specific amount you should use but I'd recommend at least 1kg.

For the cooking sauce
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 250 ml of good stout (or your preferred beer)
* 1 teaspoon of wholegrain mustard
* 6 tablespoons of BBQ sauce
* a splash of Worcester sauce

# Method

1. Set the slow cooker to low and put all the cooking sauce ingredients into the slow cooker and mix.
2. Add the pork and move it around so its coated in the sauce.

3. Cook for 6 - 8 hours on low, turning halfway. You'll know its nearly done by checking if its easily pulling with a fork.

4. Once its done as you like it, remove the pork from the slow cooker and place it in a bowl. It can be pulled apart with 2 forks. Some pork cuts have alot of fat on the outside, you can remove this if you prefer not to eat it.

5. At this point the cooking sauce will be quite thin, so I like to reduce it so its thicker. Remove all the liquid from the slow cooker and place in a sauce pan. Get it to a gentle boil for 20-30 minutes until its reduced a bit and resembles gravy in consistency. Taste for seasoning. Add brown sugar/more BBQ sauce at this point for some more sweetness if desired, or salt if necessary.
6. Return pulled pork to the slow cooker and poor over the sauce.

Thats it! Serve in toasted brioche buns with coleslaw.
