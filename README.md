Personal Blog
========
My personal blog hosted at [ifiwere.me](www.ifiwere.me).
Cloned from [mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) with some added functionality such as clickable tags and categories

Usage
---
This project is open to anyone who would like to use it, however I'd suggest going directly to mediator and forking there.

- Fork [mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator)
- Clone your fork 
- Install the requried gems ([GitHub Pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem), [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), [Jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji)): `bundle install`
- Run the jekyll server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.
